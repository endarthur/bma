# V2 Roadmap — Validation Suite, Parquet Platform, Dockable UI

2026-06-10. Successor to `v1-roadmap.md`'s Future section; incorporates and amends
the v2 platform spec (parquet/table/section/3D) and reconciles it with
`io-architecture.md`. Three tracks, largely independent — A ships value
immediately, B is the platform investment, C is the workspace.

## Decisions

| Question | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Validation suite vs platform first | **Track A first** | Small, high-value, tester benefits now; it's the identity (model QA) |
| Parquet library | Vendor **hyparquet** (pure JS) | Per v2 spec; parquet-wasm rejected (6.4 MB). **Gate: local verification of `rowGroupSize`-as-array + benchmarks before phase B2** — the claims were made off-machine |
| Row-source split | **Stands as prerequisite** for the .dm fix + 5× streaming dedup (`io-architecture.md` §1) | The v2 spec's `RowAccess` is read/seek-side and builds *on top*; it doesn't fix decode cost |
| Section overhaul scope | **Slimmed**: inline plane predicate (~10 lines, per-row DXYZ) + vendor `@gcu/dee` color.js only | `@gcu/grid slicePlane` iterates a materialized regular grid — wrong shape for streamed rows |
| Storage layer | Vendor **@gcu/vfs** (core + opfs/idb/fsaa) as the **source-resolution layer** ("phonebook, not pipe") | Mount table resolves dropped Files/FSAA handles/zip-entries-as-folders to native Files; streaming hot path never goes *through* it. Scratch = custom backend with positional writes over OPFS sync access handles |
| Layout | Vendor **@gcu/rails** (~6 KB gz), dockable panels | Domain-real (geologists work in docked layouts); dissolves tab-bar crowding; panels-coexist work is mechanical (ResizeObserver re-render) |
| Data tree panel | **Yes, with catalog semantics** (Leapfrog-style project tree), designed jointly with rails as one workspace rework | Tree = what exists (datasets, variables by kind, colors/units/roles, filters); each view keeps its own membership. NOT GIS visibility semantics — many views, legitimately different selections. Unifies the scattered per-variable property systems and is the UI prerequisite for N-dataset comparison (QP check-model practice: samples vs up to 3 estimates). Tree node model designed alongside `bma:roles` so UI and file format agree |
| works-core as host | **No** — keep sovereign single file; thin surface wrapper later, additively | Identity + the host's package model is mid-rebuild |
| Declustering | **Plain-JS GSLIB DECLUS** in worker (~80 lines); `gslib.atra` as test oracle | No wasm in BMA; DECLUS is the simple corner of GSLIB; GSLIB citation > vendor parity |
| Change of support | **r/f as user input** (slider), never derived from the model (circular) and no variography UI | Affine v0 → Hermite DGM v1; oracles: lognormal closed forms (exact) + gstlearn Python (BSD-3) |
| 3D | Sidecar per v2 spec, **after** chunk-aligned writer | Streaming 3D leans on the layout; cleanly severable |

## Track A — Validation suite

Brings the aux comparison to the full figure set QPs expect in JORC/NI 43-101
model-validation sections (conventions verified against public QP-signed reports,
e.g. Canadian Malartic 2021, New Afton 2025; methods per GSLIB / Rivoirard /
Chilès & Delfiner). Pure worker/UI increments on existing infrastructure.

| # | Feature | Size | Depends | Notes |
|---|---------|------|---------|-------|
| A1 | **% difference columns** in Statistics comparison table | S | — | The headline QP acceptance statistic (mean diff %, single-digit band). Both sides already computed; add Δ% to the aux row rendering |
| A2 | **Per-bin count bars** on swath plots | S | — | Secondary right axis, n samples / n blocks as bars — the universal QP swath template element BMA lacks. Counts already in bin payload |
| A3 | **Cell declustering weights** (aux) | M | — | GSLIB DECLUS: cell-size sweep, origin offsets, inverse-density weights, optimal size by min/max declustered mean. New *computed-weight source* (Float64Array by row ordinal) alongside `weightColName`. UI on Aux tab (range + auto/manual cell size). Harness: `experiments/` vs `../auditable/ext/gslib` `declus()` |
| A4 | **Log-probability CDF mode** | S–M | — | Probability-scale Y (Φ⁻¹, port `gauinv`), log X. Third mode of the Stats CDF panel (CDF / Q-Q / log-prob). The canonical capping figure |
| A5 | **Top-cut analysis panel** (aux) | M | A4 | Four linked views: histogram-with-cap, log-prob, mean & variance vs cap, cumulative metal vs cap; draggable cap line; before/after stats incl. Δ%. Aux column sorted once → all caps are prefix sums |
| A6 | **Theoretical GT at block support** (anamorphosis) | L | A3 | GT-tab overlay: v0 affine correction (variance factor f slider); v1 DGM (Hermite anamorphosis fit on declustered aux distribution, φₙ→φₙrⁿ, r from f by root-find; closed-form T/Q above cutoff). Per-domain via existing filters. Caveats (multigaussianity, no info effect) in help. Oracles: lognormal closed forms; gstlearn (BSD-3 Python) harness |

Out of scope, confirmed: contact analysis (needs BHID/domain-pair structure;
absent from sampled QP validation sections), variography, KNA.

## Track B — Platform (amended v2 spec)

| # | Phase | Size | Depends | Notes |
|---|-------|------|---------|-------|
| B0 | **Verify hyparquet claims** | S | — | 20-line harness: `rowGroupSize` per-group array round-trip; reproduce columnar-read + `parquetReadObjects` benchmarks locally. Gates B2/B4 design |
| B1 | **Row-source split** (+ near-term .dm patches anytime: batched page reads, `toPrecision(7)` stringify) | L | — | `CsvRowSource` / `DmRowSource` / zip composition; extracts the ~80%-shared streaming boilerplate from worker passes; fixes .dm ~30× text-round-trip. Bit-identical outputs per pass = the test |
| B2 | **Parquet adapter** | M | B0 | Vendor hyparquet (+snappy; zstd decision per spec §8.1); `PAR1` sniff; columnar `onChunk` → row adapter (never `parquetReadObjects`); preflight read-only schema mode; Model + Aux both |
| B3 | **VFS + .bma writer** | L | B0, B2 | Vendor @gcu/vfs (core/opfs/idb/fsaa); `ScratchBackend` w/ positional writes; zip-as-folder backend consolidates the three ad-hoc zip flows; `.bma` = valid parquet + KV metadata (`bma:*` keys per spec §1.5) + chunk-aligned row groups (§1.6); Export target; project paths via mounts |
| B4 | **Block index + RowAccess** | M | B1 | Per-block min/max/nulls during analysis; pushdown on filtered re-analysis; `CsvBlockIndexAccess` / `ParquetAccess` (footer stats) / `DmAccess` (arithmetic seek) |
| B5 | **Table tab** | M | B4 | Vendor @gcu/loom; PENDING provider over RowAccess + LRU; pushdown-scan vs collected-ordinals browse; detail pane |
| B6 | **Section overhaul** (slim) | M | B4 | Inline plane predicate w/ per-row DXYZ; vendor dee color.js (replaces hand-rolled colormaps, shared colorbar); slab resolution via chunk directory on .bma, block-index pushdown on CSV |
| B7 | **3D sidecar** | L | B3 | `bma-3d.js` (Three.js pinned to dee's tested rev + dee + voxmesh); streaming path on chunk-aligned .bma, budgeted binning path otherwise; Generate-button estimates; honest HUD labeling |

## Track C — Workspace

| # | Item | Size | Notes |
|---|------|------|-------|
| C1a | **Data tree, step 1: property catalog** | M | Left tree panel: datasets → variables grouped by kind (coordinates / grades / categories / calculated), per-variable color chip, unit, role badges (weight/density/class), dataset metadata. Becomes the single source of truth for the currently-scattered systems (`catColorOverrides`, swath `'aux:NAME'` color keys, GT units, weight selections) — existing per-tab pickers stay and *read* from it. Independently useful for `bma:roles` (B3) |
| C1b | **Rails dockable layout + tree as left rail** | M–L | Vendor @gcu/rails; panels coexist (ResizeObserver re-render for SVG charts — the bulk of the work); per-panel sidebars slim to view-local config (percentiles/directions/cutoffs), membership fed from the tree; layout state in `serializeProject()`; `--au-*` → BMA token map. Best landed before B5/B7 so Table/3D arrive as dockable panels. Deletes the `.results-panel.active` CSS-scoping bug class. Export keeps its full column selector (export *is* a selection task) |
| C2 | works surface wrapper | S (later) | Thin `package.json` + `works.js` around index.html, additive, after the .gcupkg registry settles. Verify VFS/mount-delegation perf on multi-GB before promising |
| C3 | (door marked, not walked through) Tree as live lineage graph | L (later) | BMA already has implicit dependency semantics (`auxStale`, stats stale marks, `analysisFingerprint()`); promoting the tree to Leapfrog-style propagate-downstream is a separate decision — engine candidate exists (`@gcu/flowsheet`: lazy, content-addressed, hash = params + upstream hashes). Likely where BMA and the works workbench eventually meet |

## Suggested order

A1+A2 (one sitting) → A3 → B0 (cheap, gates platform design) → A4 → A5 →
C1a → C1b → B1 → B2 → A6 → B3 → B4 → B5 → B6 → B7.
Track A through A5 is shippable continuously; A6 can ride alongside early B work.
C1a can slide earlier if the color/unit scatter starts hurting during Track A.

## Housekeeping (standing)

- `worker-protocol.md` / `code-map.md` refresh (stale since aux/weights/directions)
- pt-BR manual regen after UI changes (`experiments/manual-shots.js` → `manual-pdf.js`)
- `experiments/bma-swath-test.js` update for the directions-based swath protocol
- Tag a release at next push
